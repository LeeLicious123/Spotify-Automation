Thought I would try my 1st python automation project!

Do you ever listen to your Spotify Weekly Playlist, love the songs that come up but then always forget to save the songs?
I do, so I thought I would try and solve this real world crisis by automating this.

In this project, I learnt how to integrate Spotify Oauth and automate saving the Discover Weekly playlist using the Spotify API. 
In addition, I also learnt how to authenticate with Spotify, get an access token, and use it to retrieve information about a user's playlists and tracks.
